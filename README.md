PHP Webpush API implementation
=========

Allows to send messages via WebPushAPI, on different providers (Google Chrome, Mozilla), asynchronously, on multiple recipients, using multiple API keys.
  
Looks stable, but still experimental.

Functionnal for GCM and Firefox but with no VAPID implementation yet.

Based on the awesome [minishlink/web-push](https://github.com/web-push-libs/web-push-php) library.

Installation
-----
`composer require bentools/pusher`
